# Tab Switching Bug Fix - Testing Guide

## 🧪 **Testing Steps**

### **1. Initial Setup**
1. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
2. Open `http://localhost:3000` in Chrome
3. Sign in to the application
4. Navigate to the dashboard page

### **2. Test Tab Switching Scenario**
1. **Before switching**: Note that the dashboard loads correctly with data
2. **Switch to another tab** (e.g., Supabase SQL Editor or any other tab)
3. **Wait 30+ seconds** (to trigger the refetch logic)
4. **Return to the app tab**
5. **Expected behavior**: 
   - Console should show "Tab became visible, rechecking auth state..."
   - Console should show "Tab became visible, refetching data..."
   - Dashboard should refresh with new data
   - No infinite loading state

### **3. Test Focus Events**
1. **Click outside the browser window** (e.g., on desktop)
2. **Wait 30+ seconds**
3. **Click back on the browser window**
4. **Expected behavior**: Same as above

### **4. Test Network Interruption**
1. **Disconnect network** (turn off WiFi or use DevTools Network tab)
2. **Switch tabs and return**
3. **Reconnect network**
4. **Expected behavior**: App should recover and refetch data

### **5. Debug Information**
- Look for the debug panel in the bottom-right corner (development only)
- Monitor console logs for visibility/focus events
- Check that loading states reset properly

## 🔧 **What Was Fixed**

### **1. AuthProvider Improvements**
- ✅ Added `visibilitychange` and `focus` event listeners
- ✅ Implemented proper cleanup of event listeners
- ✅ Added `checkAuthState()` function to re-validate session
- ✅ Used `useRef` to track initialization state
- ✅ Added debouncing to prevent excessive API calls

### **2. Dashboard Data Fetching**
- ✅ Added visibility/focus event handling
- ✅ Implemented debounced refetching (30-second minimum interval)
- ✅ Improved useEffect dependencies
- ✅ Added proper cleanup of timeouts and event listeners
- ✅ Better error handling for stale requests

### **3. Supabase Client Configuration**
- ✅ Enhanced client configuration with better session management
- ✅ Added network event listeners
- ✅ Improved error handling for connection issues

### **4. Custom Hook**
- ✅ Created `useVisibilityFocus` hook for reusable visibility management
- ✅ Added debouncing and initialization tracking
- ✅ Proper cleanup and memory management

## 🐛 **Root Causes Identified**

1. **Stale Closures**: useEffect dependencies weren't properly managed
2. **Missing Event Listeners**: No handling of `visibilitychange` or `focus` events
3. **Session Management**: Supabase session not properly re-validated after tab switch
4. **Race Conditions**: Multiple loading states getting out of sync
5. **Network Issues**: No handling of connection interruptions

## ✅ **Expected Results**

After implementing these fixes:
- ✅ Tab switching should no longer cause infinite loading
- ✅ Data should refresh when returning to the tab (after 30+ seconds)
- ✅ Auth state should be properly re-validated
- ✅ Network interruptions should be handled gracefully
- ✅ Console logs should show proper event handling

## 🚨 **If Issues Persist**

If the bug still occurs after these fixes:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify Supabase connection is stable
3. Test with different browsers
4. Consider the fallback `location.reload()` approach as last resort

## 📝 **Notes**

- The 30-second debounce prevents excessive API calls
- Debug panel only shows in development mode
- All event listeners are properly cleaned up
- Network status is monitored for better error handling
